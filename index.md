		<h1>hey!</h1>
		<p>Nice to meet you! I'm Tiffany Lee and I'm currently a senior studying computer science at UCLA.</p>
		<p>I've studied computer science since I was in high school and I've very glad I've continued! If you want to see my resume, coursework, projects, and experience, you can click below!<br>
		I will be taking fall quarter off for an internship and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>

		<p>Free time? What's that? The quarter system at UCLA consumes all my time.<br>
		But when I do have spare time, I'm interested in photography, design, and art! I've also done a bit of 3d printing and calligraphy. I am constantly exploring new passions to figure out what I love.</p>

		<p>Just as a side note, I am constantly making adjustments and improving my website. I hope you enjoy the effort I put in to make this website look decently nice.</p>
